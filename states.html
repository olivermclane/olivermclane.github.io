    <h1><a href="https://https://www.iowa.gov/">Favorite State Website</a></h1>
    <p>Iowa has not a very slick and clean design but also a very clean layout. Iowa has a couple of quick links avaliable to its visitors. As well the website features icons aswell as a at a glace section such as the Governor and LT. Governor. Iowa also has a very nice and bright color section that helps the background color(white) mesh all together. </p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Second Favorite Website</a></h1>
    <p>Tennesse had a very slick website, and almost took first place. The website featured a nav bar and a search bar. Though I didn't like the a couple of things about the website. For starters the color scheme seemed weird and darker. As well the Nav bar and most of the page had a horrible text. This doesn't change the fact the page is super easy to navigate. Tennesse page had no quick links for useful information but had a great navigation area. </p>
    <h1><a href="https://oklahoma.gov/">Third Favorite State Website</a></h1>
    <p>While Oklahoma have a very pretty website, I didn't think it earned the number one title or even second spot. I struggled to find any navigation on the website only. I could search and the page lacked a navigation bar. I did like the images provided, aswell the page had some very key resource quickly avaliable. The webpage was mobile friendly and had a very pretty color scheme.</p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/">Honorable Mention</a></h1>
    <p>While vermonts page scaled quite easily for mobile devices the page was quite confusing. The page had a drop down navigation bar, and was very easy to navigate. Though its color theme and use of so many images made the page confusing. The information was spread across mutltiple pages but on the front page, which was quite confusing.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Non-Honorable mention....</a></h1>
    <p>Alaska's State Website for starters is not mobile friendly. The webpage looks out dated and really need work. While the page does feature a nav bar, the color scheme and design layout with the rounded corners was quite embrassing to even have on my laptop. Though the page did have some fun aspects, such as the flag status. The page just didn;t seem to flow, from the weird social media tags, and the blue to red button highlighting.</p>
