            <a href="https://www.espn.com/">ESPN.com</a>
            <p>My first chosen website is ESPN, which has several years of development and insight behind the webpage. ESPN has an entirely based color scheme of red, black, white, and grey, which helps keep a simplistic look. ESPN also makes the website exceptionally easy to navigate around; if you sign in, you can pin specific teams and items you might want to view, which is also one of the little things. The website's layout seems to be made into one column and a three-column, which for a sports website is a pro as you have your headline stacked, and you can scroll and read one by one. The website's code is up to date, including article, figure, header, fig caption, footer, etc. There are so many aspects of this website I can appreciate, and that is unique. For starters, if I am correct, the ESPN app runs off the same code and has integration at the time of the page. Another aspect of the unique website is it has a quick look at the ongoing or upcoming games featured right at the top of the page. ESPN laid out their website with their audience in mind; as a person who looks at sports, you want to read headlines one by one.</p>
            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN.com</a>
            <p>My second chosen website is CNN.com, which is another website that has several years to be developed. CNN has a remarkably similar color scheme to ESPN, with a red, white, black style. The website is in a 3-column format with the option to switch one column, which is not my favorite way to read news articles as it feels a little overwhelming. The website's navigation is quite similar; it is broken into specific categories, which makes it convenient if you want to focus on news that might impact the stock market. When you look at the code, you can see that the HTML file runs on HTML 5, as it includes elements such as div, script, style, and many more. One of the little things about the CNN website I like is that website provides quick links to current events; for example, there is a quick link to COVID news. The website, when fully expanded, has borders that keep everything centered on the page. The website is mobile-friendly and does not squish the material. Overall, a few things about that website I do not like, the clusters of information, but the pro outweighs these nitpick things.</p>
            <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale Art Website</a>

            <p>My third website is art.yale.edu, and it's quite a horrific sight. The page has elements and images overlaid. The background is an animation of someone vacuuming fire. There is no evident color theme to the page as there are several different colors that do not match at all. The page does not have a set layout as it changes throughout the page, switching from 3 columns to two-column and even one column. I wouldn't say I like much about the website as it has no purpose to me, but I do like how it is a creative wiki for the Art Students at Yale. The code does features elements from HTML 5 and is constantly being edited by the students at Yales. Elements such as div, header, button, and nav are found through the page sources. Overall, the page is quite poorly put together, but I believe that this is done on purpose by the art students.</p>
