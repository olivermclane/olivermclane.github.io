I would highly suggest visiting during summer, as the weather is nice and warm. The winter most people are indoors, possibly a good time to commence a alien invasion. In the spring, there are so many different thing to do are we transistion from cold to warm weather. In the fall everything begins to die and turn orange as leaves fall from the trees. </p>
