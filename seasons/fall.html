            <p>Here are some quick facts you probably didn't know about fall. Fall way back was called "harvest", as this is usually the time farmers harvest their product before the harsh winter. Theres also another weird part about fall that makes it quite unique, fall has two names "fall" and "autumn". What can you see in the fall, in Utah we have a beautiful fall in the back country. As everything begins to die back the hills turn bright red as the Oak Trees die. </p>
